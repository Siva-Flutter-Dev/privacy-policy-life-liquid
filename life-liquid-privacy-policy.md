Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Life Liquid app (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices that was created by SivaCrafft (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use “AS IS.”

Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include, but is not limited to:

Your device’s Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)

The pages or screens of the Application that you visit, including the time and date of your visit and the time spent on those pages

The duration of your use of the Application

The operating system of your mobile device

App activity data such as your daily water intake entries, hydration reminders, and statistics required to generate weekly/day-wise graphs

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time to deliver important updates, required notices, and promotional content.

For a better user experience, the Application may require certain personally identifiable information (such as name or email, if provided voluntarily). The information collected will be used as described in this Privacy Policy.

Reminder Notifications

The Application uses your device’s notification system to send hydration reminders.
These reminders operate locally on your device based on the schedule you configure.
No reminder content or scheduling details are shared with third parties.

Weekly/Day-Wise Graph Data

The Application records your water-intake entries to provide visual insights such as daily totals, weekly progress, and other hydration statistics.
This data is stored locally on your device and/or securely on the Service Provider’s servers (if cloud sync is implemented).
This information is not shared with third parties except as described in this policy under “Third Party Access.”

Third Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data may be periodically transmitted to external services to help the Service Provider improve the Application and the service.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

As required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena or legal process)

When disclosure is necessary to protect rights, user safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request

To trusted service providers who work on the Service Provider’s behalf, who do not have independent use of the disclosed information, and who comply with this Privacy Policy

Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application simply by uninstalling it.
Use your device’s standard uninstall process or uninstall through the mobile app marketplace.

Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider will retain User Provided Data as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter.

If you wish to request the deletion of User Provided Data, contact the Service Provider at siva.flutter.dev@gmail.com
. They will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

Children

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect or solicit data from children under the age of 13.
Children should not submit personally identifiable information through the Application or Services.
Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor and guide children's internet usage.

If you believe that a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider so appropriate actions can be taken.

Users must be at least 16 years old (or have parental consent where required by local laws) to allow processing of personally identifiable data.

Security

The Service Provider is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your information.
Physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are maintained to protect the information processed and stored.

Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
Any changes will be posted on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy regularly, as continued use of the Application indicates your acceptance of any modifications.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-11-22.
