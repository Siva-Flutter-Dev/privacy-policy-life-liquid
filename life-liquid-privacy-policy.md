This Privacy Policy applies to the Life Liquid app (the "Application") created by SivaCrafft (the "Service Provider") as a free service. This service is provided for use “AS IS.”

Personal information such as name, email, address

Any precise or approximate location data

The Service Provider does not upload, transmit, or share any hydration data to external servers.

Reminder Notifications

The Application uses your device’s local notification system to send hydration reminders.

All reminder schedules are stored locally on your device

No reminder data is transmitted or shared with third parties

Notifications operate offline and do not require an internet connection

Hydration Records & Graph Data

To display daily and weekly charts, the Application records your:

All of this information is stored only on your device, and it is used solely to generate your hydration graphs and improve your personal tracking experience.

The Application does not sync or back up your hydration data to any server.

Third-Party Access

The Service Provider does not share water-intake data, reminder data, or any personal information with third parties.

Only non-personal, aggregated, and anonymized usage information may be used internally to improve the Application.
The Service Provider may disclose information only in the following exceptional cases:

To comply with legal obligations (e.g., a court order)

To protect rights, safety, or prevent fraud

Children’s Privacy

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.
Children should not submit personal or hydration-related data without parental permission.

If you believe a child under 13 has used the Application and submitted personal data, please contact the Service Provider for removal support.

Users must be at least 16 years old, or have parental consent where required by law, to use the Application.

Security
